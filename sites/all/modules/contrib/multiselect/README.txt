Description
-------
The Multiselect module defines a CCK multiple selection field widget, to allow easier multi-selection for users.

Multiselect was redesigned for Drupal 6 by Mark W. Jarrell (attheshow) at
Jones Knowledge Group (http://www.jones.com).

Install
-------
Installing the Multiselect module is simple:

1) Copy the multiselect folder to the modules folder in your installation.

2) Enable the module using Administer -> Modules (/admin/build/modules).

3) When creating a new CCK field, select "Multiselect" as your widget type.
