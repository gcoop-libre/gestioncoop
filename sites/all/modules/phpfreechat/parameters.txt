===== Parameter List ====

    Now for the full parameters list:

    serverid
         This is the only mandatory parameter used to identify the chat server. You can compare it to the 
         server ip/host like on an IRC server. If you don't know what to write, just try : 
         $params["serverid"] = md5(__FILE__);
    language
         Used to translate the chat text and messages. Accepted values are the i18n/ sub directories names. 
         (By default, this is the local server language.)
    output_encoding
         Set a sepcific encoding for chat labels. This is really useful when the Web page embedding the 
         chat is not UTF-8 encoded. This parameter should be the same as the chat web page. Could be 
         ISO-8859-1 or anything else but it must be supported by iconv php module. (Default value: UTF-8)
    nick
         If you have already identified the user (forum, portal...) you can force the user's nickname 
         with this parameter. Defining a nick will skip the "Please enter your nickname" popup. 
         Warning : Nicknames must be encoded in UTF-8. For example, if you get nicks from a databases 
         where they are ISO-8859-1 encoded, you must convert it: $params["nick"] = iconv("ISO-8859-1", 
         "UTF-8", $bdd_nickname); (Of course, change the $bdd_nickname parameter for your needs.) 
         (Default value: "" - means users must choose a nickname when s/he connects.)
    max_nick_len
         This is the maximum nickname length, a longer nickname is forbidden. (Default value: 15)
    frozen_nick
         Setting this to true will forbid the user to change his/her nickname later. (Default value: false)
    nickmeta
         Contains some extra data (metadata) about the user that can be used to customize the display. 
         For example: the user's gender, age, real name, etc. can be setup in order to display it in the
         user's info box. A example for gender is : $params["nickmeta"] = array('gender'=>'f'); 
         (Default value: empty array)
    nickmeta_private
         Can be used to set user metadata that is only visible to admins. (Default value: array('ip') - 
         means that the user's IP address is shown to admins only)
    nickmeta_key_to_hide
         Can be used to hide keys in the final displayed whoisbox. (Default value: array() - means that
         nothing is hidden)
    isadmin
         Set this parameter to true if you want to give admin rights to the connected user. 
         Attention : if you don't use any external registration system, all your users will be admins. 
         You have to test current user rights before setting this parameter to true. (Default value: false)
    admins
         This parameter contains a list of key/value that identify admin access. The keys are the nicknames
         and the values are the corresponding passwords. Note: The "isadmin" parameter does not depend on
         this variable. (Default value: No admin/password accounts are available. Don't forget to change it.)
    firstisadmin
         When this parameter is true, it gives admin rights to the first connected user on the server. 
         (Default value: false)
    title
         Used to change the chat title that is visible just above the messages list. 
         (Default value: "My Chat")

         (Default value: one room is created named "My room")
    frozen_channels
         This parameter can be used to restrict channels to users. If the array is empty, it allows 
         users to create their own channels. (Default value: empty array)
    max_channels
         The maximum number of allowed channels for each user. (Default value: 10)
    privmsg

         (Default value: 5)
    refresh_delay
         This is the time to wait between two refreshes. A refresh is an HTTP request which asks the 
         server if there are new messages to display. If there are no new messages, then an empty HTTP
         response is returned. This parameter will be dynamically changed depending on the chat activity, 
         see refresh_delay_steps parameter for more information. (Default value: 2000 it means 2000 ms or 
         2 seconds)
    refresh_delay_steps
         This parameter is used to control the refresh_delay value dynamically. More the chat is active, 
         more the refresh_delay is low, that means more the chat is responsive. The first parameter is a 
         refresh delay value, the second is a time inactivity boundary etc ... (Default value: array
         (2000,20000,3000,60000 ... that means: start with 2s delay after 20s of inactivity, 3s delay 
         after 60s of inactivity ...)
    timeout
         This is the time of inactivity to wait before considering a user is disconnected (in milliseconds).
         A user is inactive only if s/he closed his/her chat window. A user with an open chat window is not 
         inactive because s/he sends each refresh_delay an HTTP request. (Default value: 35000 it means 
         35000 ms or 35 seconds)
    islocked
         When this parameter is true, all the chatters will be redirected to the url indicated by the 
         lockurl parameter. (Default value: false)

         to this url. (Default value: http://www.phpfreechat.net)
    skip_proxies
         Contains the list of proxies to ingore. For example: append 'censor' to the list to disable 
         words censoring. The list of system proxies can be found in src/proxies/. Attention: 'checktimeout' 
         and 'checknickchange' proxies should not be disabled or the chat will not work anymore. 
         (Default value: empty array - no proxies will be skipped)
    post_proxies
         This array contains the proxies that will be handled just before to process a command and just 
         after the system proxies. You can use this array to execute your own proxy.
         (Default value: empty array)
    pre_proxies
         This array ocntains the proxies that will be handled just before system proxies. You can use this 
         array to execute your own proxy. (Default value: empty array)

         (Default value: empty path)
    proxies_path_default
         Contains the default proxies location. Do not change this parameter if you don't know what you are

         (Default value: dirname(__FILE__).'/proxies')
    cmd_path
         This parameter indicates your own commands directory location. The chat uses commands to 
         communicate between client and server. As an example, when a message is sent, the /send your 
         message command is used, when a nickname is changed, the /nick newnickname command is used. To 
         create a new command, you have to write it and indicate in this parameter where it is located. 
         (Default value: empty string - means no custom command path is used)
    cmd_path_default
         Contains the default command path used by the system. Do not change this parameter if you don't

         Setting this to true will send a /quit command when the user closes his/her window. 
         (NOTE: Doesn't work on Firefox). This parameter isn't true by default because on IE and

         window which can be annoying. (Default value: false)
    focus_on_connect
         Setting this to true will give the focus to the input text box when connecting to the chat.

         automatically calculated)
    client_script_path

         on the forum. (Default value: false)
    dyn_params
         Most of the chat parameters are stored in a internal cache for performances issues. It means that 
         for all the clients the chat will have the same parameters. However sometime you need to customize 
         some parameters for each clients. For example: the 'language' parameter could depends on the 
         chatter profil so it could interesting to ignore the cache for this parameter. The 'dyn_params' 
         contains the parameters that need to be dynamic (not stored in the cache). (Default value: array())
